# Calorie-Counter-Project-
The Calorie Counter is a web application that helps users track their daily calorie budget. It allows users to input their calorie intake from meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks), calories burned from exercises, and then calculates the remaining calorie balance. The result displays whether the user is in a calorie Surplus or Deficit.
